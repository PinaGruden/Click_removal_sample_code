A sample code to de-click an audio file. 


Copyright (c) 2021, Pina Gruden

This code performs a three stage processing to eliminate impulsive signals (echolocation clicks) from the audio file. 

Run "Sample_code_for_declicking.m" to remove echolocation clicks from a file "Example_FKW_wWhistlesandClicks.wav".

More extensive audio datasets can be found at http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/ore/dclde/dataset/ - This DCLDE Kona dataset consists of a subset of passive acoustic data collected using a multi-channel towed hydrophone array during the Hawaiian Islands Cetacean and Ecosystem Assessment Survey (HICEAS) in 2017 by NOAA Pacific Island Science Center.
